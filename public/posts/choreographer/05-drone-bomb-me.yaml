title: Drone Bomb Me
description: Solo improvisation work inspired by musical narratives of Anohni. 'The price of true life is always death. Death of insecuruties, personalities, thousands of minds hidden inside. We can never find a path to a true self without facing our fatal initiation. To become real, be ready to pay a decent price. We might experience hundreds of 'deaths' in our life before we are trully 'born' into the only one, a True one...' 2017, Moscow
